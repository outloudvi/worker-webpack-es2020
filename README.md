# worker-webpack-es2020

Want to use pretty ES2020 features when writing Cloudflare Workers scripts? It's possible thanks for Webpack and Babel.

Is it difficult to configure? Maybe yes, but not with this template repository.

This sample adds support for [optional chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining).

See <https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins> for more plugins that you may want to use. To use them, install them as devDependencies and add them to `.babelrc.js`.
